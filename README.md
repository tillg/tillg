### Hello everybody ðŸ‘‹

I'm a guy that used to develop for money, now managing software projects (whatever that means...). Coding now became a hobby in order to understand what people are talking about in our industry.

Things I play around with currently:

* [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com), because at [mgm technology partners](https://www.mgm-tp.com) I work with a team that is in charge of Build & Deployment of [A12 Applications](https://a12.mgm-tp.com).
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com), actually more `docker-compose`, as a service on it's own usually feels lonely...
* [Ghost](https://ghost.org) because I run a little personal blog (check out the recipies ðŸ˜œ). And of course I [set up all this with Ansible and Docker](https://github.com/tillg/ghost.docker.compose)...
* [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com) because you need it in almost every setup. Also I wanted to have parts of my website non-public and therefore started investigating [how to have password protected content with Nginx](https://github.com/tillg/nginx_with_logins).
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) because I wanted to learn JavaScript & TypeScript.
