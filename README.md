### Hello everybody 👋

I'm a guy that used to develop for a salary, now managing software projects (whatever that means...). Coding now became a hobby in order to understand what people are talking about in our industry.

My fact sheet:

* Till Gartner from Munich/Germany/Europe/Planet Earth 🌍
* Board Member at [mgm technology partners](https://www.mgm-tp.com) (a great software company that is always [looking for smart people](https://www.mgm-tp.com/en/jobs/)). Currently dealing with projects that are based on our [A12 Platform](https://a12.mgm-tp.com/index_en.html)
* Father, speaking German, French and English. Studied Math at the [TUM](https://www.tum.de/en/)


Things & technologies I play around with currently:

* [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com), because at [mgm technology partners](https://www.mgm-tp.com) I work with a team that is in charge of Build & Deployment of [A12 Applications](https://a12.mgm-tp.com).
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com), actually more `docker-compose`, as a service on it's own usually feels lonely...
* [Ghost](https://ghost.org) because I run a little personal blog (check out the [recipies](https://grtnr.de/tag/recettes/) 😜). And of course I [set up all this with Ansible and Docker](https://github.com/tillg/ghost.docker.compose)...
* [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com) because you need it in almost every setup. Also I wanted to have parts of my website non-public and therefore started investigating [how to have password protected content with Nginx](https://github.com/tillg/nginx_with_logins).
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) because I wanted to learn JavaScript & TypeScript.
